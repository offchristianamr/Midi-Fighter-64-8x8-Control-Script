# Midi-Fighter-64-8x8-Control-Script
A modified version of the Midi Fighter 64 control script created by padi04 for launching clips using all 64 buttons.

After updating the Midi Fighter 64 control script to work with Ableton Live 11, I decided to further modify the script to fully take advantage of the 64 buttons by using an 8x8 matrix. This script was made by taking that updated version of padi04's script and commenting out as much as I could before the script stopped working. It's not pretty, but it works.
Some values were changed to use the top row of buttons, but the code was kept as close to the original as possible.

I left comments in the mf_64.py file to explain certain elements of the script.
